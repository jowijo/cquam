AM Stereo flowgraph for GNURadio. Implementation of Motorola's CQUAM standard for AM Stereo transmission in GNURadio. The flowgraph uses native blocks, and requires no extra dependancies.
##Usage
The defaul configuration takes audio samples from a FIFO. An example of sending music to the transmitter is below:
```
mpg123 -s http://127.0.0.1:8000 | ./stc - - -s mw.sts > /tmp/play
```
* mpg123 plays my mpd stream.
* ./stc is my audio processor, Stereo Tool. This is optional.
* '/tmp/play' is the named pipe which will send the audio data to the transmitter.

In any case, most audio programs that run in a command-line should put out valid samples; so long as they a piped through '/tmp/play'. Alternatively, you can replace the file block with an audio block for ALSA or JACK input, but bear in mind JACK does not support Stereo input, and ALSA is often slow and impairs performance. 

The signal generated by the graph is a baseband C-QUAM signal. Simply attaching the virtual device to the UHD or osmosdr block with proper parameters shold produce a proper signal for testing. This was tested on a BladeRF and worked. The WAV dump of the generated signal was tested in SoDiRa software, and played as intended.
